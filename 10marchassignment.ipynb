    "Answer:  estimation statistics involves making educated guesses about population parameters using sample data. Point estimates provide single-value approximations, while interval estimates (confidence intervals) provide a range of values with a certain level of confidence. The choice between point and interval estimates depends on the context and the level of certainty desired in the estimation."

    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. It involves formulating two competing hypotheses about a population characteristic, such as the population mean or proportion, and then using sample data to assess which hypothesis is more plausible. The two hypotheses are known as the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (Ha).\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis (H0) typically represents a default or \"no effect\" assumption, stating that there is no significant difference or relationship between variables or that any observed difference is due to random chance. The alternative hypothesis (Ha), on the other hand, represents the claim we are trying to test or the possibility of an effect or relationship between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis testing process involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Formulation of Hypotheses: Define the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (Ha) based on the research question or claim.\n",

    "Collect Data: Obtain a sample from the population of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test Statistic: Calculate a test statistic based on the sample data and the chosen statistical test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Significance Level: Choose a significance level (alpha), which represents the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. Commonly used significance levels are 0.05 (5%) and 0.01 (1%).\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Rule: Compare the calculated test statistic with the critical value or p-value associated with the chosen significance level to decide whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",

    "Student's t-distribution, also known as the t-distribution, is a probability distribution that arises in statistical inference when working with small sample sizes and unknown population standard deviations. It is used for making inferences about the population mean when the sample size is small or when the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-distribution is similar in shape to the standard normal distribution (z-distribution), but it has heavier tails, which means it has more probability in the tails and less probability in the center compared to the standard normal distribution. As the sample size increases, the t-distribution approaches the standard normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-distribution is characterized by its degrees of freedom (df), which is a parameter that determines the shape of the distribution. The degrees of freedom depend on the sample size and play a crucial role in calculating t-statistics and p-values in hypothesis testing.\n",

    "When to use the t-Distribution:\n",
    "The t-distribution is used in the following scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "Small Sample Size: When working with small sample sizes (typically n < 30), the t-distribution is preferred over the standard normal distribution for making inferences about the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
